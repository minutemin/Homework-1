HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refractor

## Description ##

HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refractor


This assignment was designed for real world experience, starting from creating a repository to deploying a project.  It focuses on refractoring the code so that it includes semantics and add additional meta for clarity.  The Refractoring solves accessibilty issues and gives the student practice with agile workflow, HTML, CSS and git/github.  

First I created a new repo in my github and committed a read me file and license. Then I cloned it to my computer.  From my terminal, I created a new branch called "feature/refractor-starter-code and copied and pasted the Unsolved assignment files into the homework-1 directory in the feature branch.  After I worked on the code, fix all the acceptance criteria, I first git pull to make sure I have updated version of the project.  I then git add -A and git commit with message of my changes.  Then I pushed it to my github to my feature branch, and then proceeded with a pull request so that it could be merged into the main branch.  I then merged the feature branch into the main and have it deployed to my git pages.
